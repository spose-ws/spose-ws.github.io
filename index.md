# About the Workshop


Over the past decades, a multitude of security and privacy enhancing technologies has been developed and brought to considerable maturity. However, the design and engineering of such technologies often ignores the organizational context that respective technologies are to be applied in. Building upon the success of three past iterations held at ESORICS 2019-2021, this workshop aims to enrich engineering practice in the field of security and privacy with solid insights from organizational and behavioral sciences to pave the way for technical security and privacy mechanisms and systems that match organizational needs and givens better than current ones. We particularly welcome papers explicitly translating findings and insights from organizational and behavioral theory into the concrete design and engineering of technical security and privacy mechanisms as well as papers evaluating, assessing, or scrutinizing existing security and privacy technologies against actual organizational and behavioral theories and/or givens from the practice.

Papers providing a clear engineering contribution based on non-technical insights are especially welcome and will be particularly recognized in the review process.
