# The 1st Workshop on Security, Privacy, Organizations, and Systems Engineering at ESORICS 2019


Over the past decades, a multitude of security and privacy enhancing technologies has been developed and brought to considerable maturity. However, the design and engineering of such technologies often ignores the organizational context that respective technologies are to be applied in. This workshop aims to bring together engineering and organizational/behavioral scientists active in the field of security and privacy in order to facilitate a better match between those – so far – largely disconnected perspectives. It’s explicit goal is to pave the way for technical security and privacy mechanisms and systems that match organizational needs and givens better than current ones.
