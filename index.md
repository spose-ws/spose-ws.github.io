# About the Workshop


Over the past decades, a multitude of security and privacy enhancing technologies has been developed and brought to considerable maturity. However, the design and engineering of such technologies often ignores the organizational context that respective technologies are to be applied in. This workshop aims to enrich engineering practice in the field of security and privacy with solid insights from organizational and behavioral sciences to pave the way for technical security and privacy mechanisms and systems that match organizational needs and givens better than current ones. We welcome technical contributions that soundly reflect insights from organizational and behavioral sciences as well as contributions from non-technical domains providing (empirical and theoretical) insights that help improve technical security and privacy mechanisms.
